## Success Criteria
If your particle filter passes the current grading code in the simulator (you can make sure you have the current version at any time by doing a `git pull`), then you should pass! 

The things the grading code is looking for are:


1. **Accuracy**: your particle filter should localize vehicle position and yaw to within the values specified in the parameters `max_translation_error` and `max_yaw_error` in `src/main.cpp`.

2. **Performance**: your particle filter should complete execution within the time of 100 seconds.
